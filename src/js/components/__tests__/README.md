# WebComponents Unit tests

The tests in this directory are run by **karma**. They test rendering and behaviour of the WebComponents, directly in a browser (in order to rely on real DOM APIs for customElements, shadowDOM ...)

Config:

- [karma.config.js](../../../../karma.config.js)

You can find the tests for the logic (reducers, containers ...) run by jest in [/src/js/\_\_tests\_\_](../../__tests__).
